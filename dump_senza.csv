110, beautiful we loved it here the internet was a little slow but that is the only negative the hotel is walking distance to a restaurant which was very convenient we really liked the hot tub and sitting by the fire after the rooms were great staff was helpful and we loved scenery 
111, senza is a very good property near napa strategically located in the valley with napa to the south and several quaint small towns to the north an unexpected room upgrade made this stay much better prices are reasonable for the areastaff was friendly and very helpful with suggestions on wineries and restaurants room was modern as described by other guests

114, ill start with the positives the room was very spacious and well appointed nice decor all in all very nice we stayed up in room  in the hall block supposedly the quietest and most expensive rooms the room had a beautiful view of the vineyard and the super busy road and now the areas of concern the road noise

117, we have never stayed here when it was la residence but i can tell you we thoroughly enjoyed our  day stay here at senza we had room  which is a corner suite and probably the most private room on the property it is very contemporary so if the minimalist look is not to your taste then you may 
118, the hotel felt very cosy and homy the room was large clean and very comfortable the fireplace was a great asset for chilly mornings and evenings breakfast was a very nice selection of local goodies and the nespresso machine topped it all off the daily wine tastings with local cheeses and salamis were great we would definitely recommend this hotel 
119, i would be less than candid when driving to senza hotel that the howard lane address gave me a bit of concern silly me this best in class   star hideaway blew me away nestled in a vineyard our arrival was greeted by a professional and gleaming staff our accommodations over the top the huge spa like bathroom the

134, we had stayed at la residance with our children years ago and remember it as friendly cozy place with beautiful gardens and rooms that varied from inn like in the mansion to newer luxury rooms on the northern side of the property the two friendly owners apparently sold it to the current company which completely remodeled it and added two new 
135, we had a beautiful and squeaky clean room with a wonderful view the customer service was excellent from the minute we booked the room until the moment we checked out as a bonus the continental breakfast was anything but quiche baked goods from bouchon berries and espresso  yum i plan to stay at the senza every time im in the napa area

183, spent two nights here on a trip to napa we really enjoyed the hotel although it was probably a bit overpriced so we got a senza king room and while it was a nice size the room as a whole was very bland the walls were bare and that was a bit odd the fire place was great and though 
184, all i can say is wow what an incredible experience at this hotel the staff was so accommodating and helpful we got in a little early one day and they were so friendly and allowed us to check in early the hotel rooms are luscious and beautiful and very modern they have a built in fireplace nice patio to relax

212, we absolutely loved the modern decor and amenities of this secluded yet conveniently located boutique hotel from the wonderful breakfast to the daily wine tastings the well appointed rooms to the private pool cabanas senza has everything you can think of for a romantic stay 
213, ditto what dinnerguest said in their review we had similar experience and had an upstairs room on the end that probably helped the quiet comfortable stay the staff was wonderful helpful and eager to please their concierge services helped me plan a trip i had little time to research and it was terrific they made tour food and other suggestions 
214, the property seemed nice enough it was beautifully decorated and clean however it was not quite a luxury property and heres why the walls were very thin this made for interesting nighttime listening and in the morning the vacuum upstairs sounded like a jet engine if i were sleeping i would have been pissed i didnt like their no later 
215, i recently stayed at senza with my wife on a long weekend trip to escape the northeast cold and celebrate a birthday we had a terrific time at senza and loved the close proximity to yountville and how easy it was to get up the valley in the morning we also absolutely loved the outdoor fire pit and we would

230, senza is a small boutique hotel in the perfect location if you are in the napa area for wine tasting our room was fantastic it had sliding glass doors leading to a small furnished patio that overlooked a soon to be planted vineyard a wide screen tv was over a gas burning fireplace the room came with a complimentary bottle of wine 
231, we started in the mansion   parker mansion   and i thought ok i give it six hours until my wife asks to move rooms she was a good sport about it until she realized she forgot her sleeping pills then all of the sudden the room was a little too noisy   being right off highway  i thought 
232, this  room brand new hotel is situated only min drive from yountville based on their website it is hard to figure out the differences between the rooms basically there are  different buidlings apart from the parker mansion which is a restored building renovated with some very charming and cosy rooms the rooms in the other buidlings are quite similar 
233, booked from looking at the web sites their site looked really good so we opted for a vineyard suite the fireplace kept us warm the heated floors kept our toes cozy warm and the bed was comfortable the wine reception was hosted by a different winery every night and the breakfast was a gourmet meal the view from our room 
234, we stayed here on a monday night i wanted two beds rather than a king so the nice woman at the desk gave us a garden suite it was beautiful and so peaceful th room was unreal  fireplace heated floors amazing tub the breakfast was awesome i would come here every weekend if i could the hot tub was perfect 
235, our stay was absolutely fabulous we stayed in a fantastic room that overlooked their cabana surrounded pool our room featured a high ceiling in the bedroom and the spacious bathroom had heated floors which was an absolute dream given the chilly spring mornings and evenings in northern california there was a beautifully furnished balcony outside our room where we enjoyed a 
236, the hotel is cute but very close to the highway the staff were friendly and accommodating but things didnt quite work as planned they arranged a car for us and the price was  more per hour at the end of the day than we had been quoted they also arranged for a private wine tasting but when we arrived 
237, i am so in love with this hotel i kept asking my husband if we could move in the hospitality the ambiance the breakfast and wine hour the beautiful surroundings and spectacular location were all top of the line we travel quite a bit and this was one of my favorite hotels i have ever stayed in we had a 
238, looooove this hotel so nice and relaxing perfectl location includes breakfast in the morning with bouchon pastries and more and wine and cheese tasting every afternoon we were in a suite and liked it a lot clean beatiful with a nice balcony that invites you to seat and just look at the landscape recommended 
239, we arrived at senza on march th and stayed only one night to say we were impressed by the hotel overall would be an understatement from what i understand there are several different houses or buildings with several different rooms within each our room was in the main building where the lobby is located we stayed in room  which

254, we absolutely loved our stay at this boutique hotel great rooms the fireplace was an amazing touch with robes great products   everything felt clean homey and luxurious close to yountville and many amazing wineries   just a quick drive away great wine hour and breakfast buffet featuring pastries from bouchon   yum we will definitely come back and stay 
255, the remodeled senza hotel is impressive our room was modern but had a very warm ambiance special touches like robes provided heated bathroom floor complimentary breakfast that was first class made our stay very enjoyable the staff was extremely attentive and helpful we would definitely stay at senza on a future trip to napa 
256, this is a relatively new hotel it opened late last year used to be la residence over all landscape is nicely done because it is next to the st helena hwy the front units can be a bit noisy we asked to change to mid section room and it is much better althought not as many windows as the corner 
257, we stayed here one night and enjoyed the wine hour the room was particularly a stand out it had a fireplace the bathroom amenities were great great cosmetics and luxurious towels beds were comfortable gowns available and iron and ironing board ipod docking station was great add too all rooms are close to the reception where breakfast is served breakfast 
258, we loved this hotel we stayed in a relaxing modern clean room with an awesome fireplace the huge freestanding tub and heated bathroom floor were my favoritesmy husband loved the breakfast with locally made pastries and the happy hour with wine tasting and we both loved the fact that we sat on our patio within arms reach of grapevines we 
259, we absolutely loved this hotel the fireplace the balcony overlooking the soon to be vineyard the soaking tub wonderful wine tasting each evening really i could go on we stayed in a vineyard king suite and my only complaint was that it is on the main road while this makes it super convenient to visit wineries you could hear road noise while 
260, the rooms are large clean and modern we stayed in one with a fireplace and that was nice to have if they had more staff that would have been good there are not many and they are usually busy i like the breakfast that is included great pastries 
261, our one night stay here was not enough senza is a small modern fairly new boutique hotel located right off of the highway the only qualm was a bit of traffic noise from our room our room was immaculate and smelled very fresh when we arrived the rooms are contemporary with fireplaces and although there was no bathtub in the 
262, so glad i was able to stay at senza to check out their redo i love how they modernized but still have the personal touches that make a stay here so enjoyable will definitely try to visit again soon 
263, my first trip to napa and was totally impressed with the beauty of the senza hotel stayed in a vineyard view room can only image what the view would be during harvest the fireplace and heated bathroom floors were a definitely plus for those cool evenings and mornings in january the staff was so personable and helpful and available for

278, i was fortunate enough to stay at senza during a businesspleasure trip and was blown away by the seclusion and beauty of this hotel the rooms are spacious and love the heated floors of course the fireplace completes the setting 
279, after completing a recent renovation and addition as well as getting a new name the senza certainly lives up to its position as a top napa boutique hotel while they do not have a restaurant on site they do provide wine tastings with small bites in the late afternoon and breakfast including danish from bouchon bakery in the mornings our 
280, staff was very nice and helpful we stayed in a delightful suite on the second floor the room was spacious with a wonderful sitting area and fire place the large tub gigantic shower and heated floors made the bathroom one of the nicest weve seen the nightly wine and cheese tasting and daily breakfast were complimentary and very well done 
281, after a negative phone experience with another resort property in the area i was so pleased to speak with marta tonight and book a room at senza for a one night getaway judging from her superb and straightforward service we will be sure to have a delightful stay 
282, although we had a great stay overall just after xmas i have to agree with previous reviewers comments that the whole place lacks warmth and a personal touch as well as more staff to show you around give you recommendations on wineries to visit etc it has to be made clearer that although you are in the middle of vineyards 
283, senza was a dream from the moment you step on the property it feels like youre in another world on a chilly day having a glass of wine by the fire pit was perfect as was coming back to the room and turning on the fireplace in the room every touch was well considered from the soft linens to the 
284, i came here with my boyfriend to have a romantic weekend getaway we booked the yule love us package for  where we could choose between garden suites and vineyard suites as well as having a bottle of wine and chocolate covered strawberries upon our arrival bottom line the rooms were spectacular but i would probably not stay here again 
285, this newly renovated hotel is simply perfect pure luxury with tasteful decor beautifully appointed rooms attentive and friendly staff everything you need is at your disposal pool with cabanas hot tub spa services best massage ive had in a long time conference services  the list goes on they have a lovely wine hour in the evening and delicious continental 
286, beautiful modern guest rooms with gas fireplaces and almost everything you could ask for breakfast included we had a wonderful time we will definitely visit again and stay longer this hotel is worth the price and more 
287, this was my first visit to senza and we traveled all the way from texas to have a fun girls week end in napa we arrived late in the evening and the staff was warm and welcoming our room was really nice and cozy and the fireplace added a nice touch literally you push the button to turn it on add

301,people keep talking about the cottages or cabins but when i look to book they do not show any cottages are the vineyard suites the cottages 
302, i never write reviews but i stayed at senza for an evening mid november and was absolutely blown away by the beautiful accommodations and incredible service the property was recently remodeled and it is stunning the rooms are luxurious yet approachable with every amenity imaginable    from the high quality robes and slippers the most comfortable beds a huge shower 
303, i was very happy with my room and my stay here lovely fireplace in the room beautiful comfortable bed and linens nice tiled walk in shower and an outdoor pool and sauna on the propertyand the best gourmet continental breakfast ever with baked goods from bouchon bakeryconveniently located off the highway between downtown napa and yountville i hope to stay 
304, im hesitant to post a review because i worry everyone will descend on senza and then ill have a hard time booking it next time we didnt know what to expect but what a pleasant surprise the hotel and property is full of beautiful art from lessor known artists its a very modern beautifully decorated hotel the rooms are comfortable 
305, we stayed here last night and were disappointed with the noise from other hotel rooms the decor is nice and modern and the rooms are spacious however there was clearly very little insulation put in to sound proof the rooms we could hear the hotel room above us everything from them walking around to even using the restroom gross given 
306, we had a fabulous mother daughter week end at senza we arrived late on friday evening and our room was ready and inviting i love the new contemporary decor and the beds were made for a cozy nights sleep i am a pillow perfectionist and these were perfect for me we were able to turn on the fire place and it automatically 
307, we recently booked senza for a last minute trip after finding that all of the good hotels in the napayountville area were either booked for the weekend or required a friday and saturday night stay when we booked it showed that only the parker plus mansion rooms were available these i believe are some of the least expensive rooms located 
308, when we booked the reservation the hotel was listed as la residence with numerous photos showing very homey comfortable looking rooms while the staff was friendly and welcoming and the grounds are pleasant the makeover to the hotel now has a very modern feel the room was small and sparsely furnished with an unfinished look since there was no wall 
309, my wife and i recently visited senza formerly la residance for our first stop on our honeymoon we both had never been to napa let alone california before this trip when we first arrived we were amazed at the grounds the hotel is located on right next to vineyards and with vines growing on the property the ambiance was wonderful 
310, this was my th time out in wine country and have stayed at the other  finer hotels on this visit senza was not my first choice but the other hotels couldnt fit us in we stumbled open senza and this made the trip the grounds are beautiful everything is pristine and the staff was wonderful breakfast was much more 
311, we were fortunate to get a reservation on a sold out weekend at the new senza hotel in napa for my husbands birthday celebration i cant say enough good things about this place it is absolutely glorious everything is pristine eco friendly and of the very highest quality we happened to be checking in as they were serving their complementary nightly wine

327, booked this hotel because other affordable hotels were full and this was our bi annual visit during high season i reserved the standard king parker classic for our th anniversary upon arrival the building of that room sustained earthquake damage and we upgraded us to a larger new king suite with a gas fireplace i asked they charge the original booked 
328, now a boutique hotel called senza beautiful grounds lush linens very spacious rooms and bathrooms also fireplace balcony and calming decor the staff was more than accommodating  joseoh was so helpful and pleasant pool spa area fire pit and any amenity you could wish for daily continental breakfast from bouchon was more than you would ever want to eat and 
329, we booked a room with a view on the wineyards unfortunately the hotel is in restoration instead of a wineyard we had a beautiful view on a wasteland with dumps on it also even if we inform the manager that the lights were not fonctionning on our balconny durint the firts nigth they did not fix the problem for the 
330, it just re opened after an overhaul and this place is amazing spacious comfortable rooms bouchon bakery for breakfast everyday wine hour every night and a staff that was more than willing to help in any way they could we wouldnt think of staying anywhere else 
331, we were fortunate to get a reservation on a sold out weekend at the new senza hotel in napa for my husbands birthday celebration i cant say enough good things about this place it is absolutely glorious everything is pristine eco friendly and of the very highest quality we happened to be checking in as they were serving their complementary nightly wine 
332, after closing for  months la residance reopened on august   there is a name change the hotel will be called the senza hotel the hotel has been modernized and  buildings were added everything is new the bedding and towels are all new the staff was being retrained and not all the rooms were open the grounds are 
333, it was such an adorable place to spend a night or two in napa i love their garden and their building staff were extremely friendly and helpful i went to napa with my mom and by the time i booked my trip they already out of their two beds room when i arrived the staff told us that he felt sorry

350, this week was our th stay at la residence the moment we stepped on the property  years ago  we knew it was something special it is a small understated elegant property with cedar shingled buildings surrounded by lovely trees gardens and vineyards it is steps away from one of napas finest restaurants don giovannis la residence is the gateway to 
351, this is a great place to stay feels very comfortable great areas to sit and enjoy some quite time staff is very helpful and good meal in the morning they have a great wine and cheese every evening you can walk to don giovani for a good meal  min to yountville 
352, stayed here on our anniversary trip to napa we stayed in the mansion the service was great we absolutely loved sitting by the fire pit at night and the staff was more than happy to light it give us wood for the rest of the night etc the breakfast was sufficient nice to be able to grab a bagel or 
353, we had a great time at la residence the location is between downtown napa and the long stretch of wineries to the north so its a short drive either way the grounds are pretty well kept and quiet the room itself was nice we stayed in the deluxe king and clean we enjoyed the complimentary wine and cheese tasting both nights 
354, we really enjoyed our stay here and found it very warm and friendly the hotel fits really well in with the local area the room was clean spacious and charming the daily breakfast was excellent   good choice and coffee readily available throughout the day the evening wine and cheese tasting was a lovely touch and we looked forward to 
355, the staff at la residence is incredible before we even got to napa the concierge contacted us and offered to plan wine tours and tastings for us outstanding service the breakfast each morning was delicious and there was a nice variety the property is gorgeous la residence is a quiet peaceful retreat staying here put us close to both napa 
356, we enjoyed our stay at la residence and found it very warm and welcoming there is a wine and cheese reception from   pm nightly while the pool was unheated thus not usable the hot tub was delightful and the robes provided were perfect to walk there there is coffee available  hours a day which is really nice especially 
357, the inn was delightful we enjoyed a peaceful stay where the staff was extremely accommodating the room was clean spacious and charming  each eve we enjoyed the wine tasting and sharing recommendations with the other guests it was nice to wake to the coffee and light breakfast i highly recommend it 
358, the la residence country inn in napa valley is like being at home but better because you are not doing the clean up we went to celebrate a birthday and an anniversary there was a lovely card in our room and cheese cake in the refrigerator plus warm chocolate chip cookies when we arrived the grounds are beautiful there is 
359, really enjoyed our stay at la residence each evening they invite guests to join them for wine tasting and nibbles which is a lovely touch our room was beautiful and clean with the added luxury of molton brown toiletries highly recommend for peaceful getaway

374, a beautiful setting and wonderful service a little slice of heaven for those looking to unwind our room in the mansion was spacious and nicely appointed loved the fireplace dont miss the corner bistro   a wonderful surprise 
375, let me start by saying that we had a lovely visit to the napa area but my standards are high for any place that is costing me night pros beautiful grounds with lovely seating areas clean easy access to  wine and cheese in afternoons ok   cheese better than wines poured we are in napa after all breakfast options 
376, perfect spot to launch wine tours and special dining the cottages are wonderful and the hospitality is fantastic great coffee pastries fruit etc in the morningwine and cheese at days end was always welcome and fun dont miss this place 
377, this was our fifth stay at la residence in napa and we will definitely stay there again on our next trip to the valley the rooms are cozy and unique the morning breaksfast is not overwhelming but it is adequate for our purposes and the overall ambiance of this faciliity outweighs the somewhat sparse nature of the breakfast the afternoon 
378, this is a very nice property with good location very nice rooms and polite staff pricing was very reasonable with well above average and included complimentary internet as well as wine and cheese tasting pm   pm highly recommended 
379, i am not sure if the country experience is the best for the wine country la residence location by the highway between napa and yountville limits the possibility of a good long walk without having to drive for a few miles and park your car besides from that it is perfect good service professional and kind our room was big 
380, my husband and i just returned from a wonderful trip to napa valley we booked a room at la residence a few months before our trip candy was very sweet and sent an email to see if we needed help with scheduling any tours she gave us a great recommendation for a private driver on saturday so that we could 
381, i want to start by saying we have not stayed here yet however i felt compelled to write and say we are so looking forward to hosting our wedding accommodations here next year the staff esp alana have been so tremendously helpful prompt on returning emails always open to providing tips  so much more i can not wait to 
382, la residence was such a great find   really a hidden gem tucked out of the way in a great location which is very accessible to the wineries the property has beautiful grounds and the rooms are well appointed but cozy and comfortable there is a lot of history at the property especially the mansion which has historic charm combined with 
383, a very small and intimate place an old main house with some newer buildings in the grounds the staff were helpful and friendly and the room in the old house lovely that said unless you sleep like a log it would be better to get one of the rooms in the newer buildings which appear to have double glazing there

398, at first we were surprised that la residence is outside the little city of napa we quickly learned that was a huge plus so every trip back from a long day of wine tasting didnt have to include rush hour traffic into the city would recommend to anyone my only issue was that the bathrooms are a little outdated but 
399, my friends and i just experienced a wonderful girls trip to napa and la residence was the perfect place to stay the grounds are gorgeous and the staff starting with graham the general manager to dave marta and all the others were experienced and friendly hosts plus our rooms were spacious and well appointed we loved the hall vineyards wine 
400, we took a recent girls trip to napa and stayed at la residence and it was so relaxing from the manager graham to the bellman dave and marta who served us wine and great food the service was outstanding the rooms were very comfortable the grounds were beautiful and we were surrounded by vineyards what more could you want we 
401, we stayed here for  nights and found this place to be just what we wanted a small intimate inn located in napa valley the rooms were spacious the breakfast was lovely and the nightly wine and cheese was an added touch the location is between napa and yountville which are both great little towns and close to all of 
402, we had the best room right in the vineyard suite with bedroom living room and great bath spacious and lovely hot tub outside wine and cheeses in the afternoon and breakfast   all delicious would go back again wish we could have stayed longer 
403, i stayed at la residence for my engagement weekend with my girlfriend i couldnt have asked for a better hotel service and overall experience i let the staff know that i was planning on proposing and they were extremely helpful they helped me find a spot on the property to pop the question had great dinner recommendations and helped me 
404, my wife and i were married at la residence and returned for our tenth anniversary we returned because we liked it so much during our wedding as always the staff is great everyone had a smile and had the answer to every question a very big thank you to kelly for the split of champagne cheesecake and strawberries when she 
405, we stayed at la residence for  nights for my birthdaylabor day we were surprised and delighted to be upgraded from our garden room to an amazing two bedroom two bath full kitchen swo storey separate house on the property apparently the residence of the original owners it was amazing luxurious beds with great pillows immaculate furnishings and great toiletries 
406, peaceful quiet relaxing the first three adjectives that come to mind my wife and i stayed at la residence as part of her birthday celebration the grounds are beautiful as is the entire countryside a small vineyard resides on the property fountains art as well a multiple buildings that one can choose to stay in my wife and i were 
407, my wife and i have recently returned from a anniversary vacation where we stayed at la residence in napa as per my title this place is somewhat like a hotel in the fact that each guest has their own room and bathroom with an external door where it feels like its a bed  breakfast is that its extremely inviting

422, la residence was the perfect little spot for a night or two in napa very cozy nice rooms friendly staff and more than adequate breakfast with a view it would be tough to stay here for a long visit as its not super easy to get in and out of town but other than that its a winner 
423, we enjoyed this hotel very much it was quiet peaceful and a great room the breakfast was excellent the views were nice and you could watch the balloons each morning sailing over napa valley we will stay there again when we return to napa the wine reception each evening was a very nice touch 
424, we stayed  nights in the king cottage suite the rooms were clean spacious and quiet view from the porch was nice and relaxing breakfast was very good evening wine was also pleasant offering an opportunity to meet other guests and forge new friendships wine from hill vineyards was good service was always pleasant and timely we tried  of 
425, wonderful peaceful place will go again the rates are great so is the food and beds were wonderful as well i stayed at vrbo  and liked it as well it is a wonderful house over the water with plenty of toys 
426, this inn was booked last minute and we were delighted located among large trees and lush gardens you couldnt ask for a more gorgeous setting for drinking wine and reading a book there is a beautiful patio next to the dining room where we enjoyed complimentary wine and cheese the rooms were cozy clean and comfortable the staff were friendly 
427, we stayed here for  nights it was a great place to stay it was close to wineries and great to come back to wine and cheese nightly they have a nice breakfast as well i had a bad mattress but after consulting with dave who is grounds keeper he tried to make it as pleasant as possible for me 
428, we loved la residence from the moment we arrived the grounds are beautiful with lovely fountains and outdoor seating areas the deck off the interior dinng room for our evening wine and cheese pairings was really lovely with the backdrop of the hills of the wine country rooms are cozy and quite comfortable with king bed and high quality linens 
429, we just got back from a weeklong trip to ca we started in sf and drove up to napa for two nights la residence was a prime location for us since we were able to hit the wineries in napa yountville st helena and calistoga plus be close to downtown napa the grounds were beautiful with flower beds fountains and 
430, my husband and i spend  nights at the la residence and loved it location is great just on the north edge of napa the grounds are beautiful and the property is very well maintained they offer a nice breakfast every morning and wonderful wine reception in the evening we met some very nice people on our stay and were 
431, just got back from  days at la residence and had an amazing time we got upgraded to the  bedroom house and it was an incredible space it was lovely for the  of us but would be even better if you had  couples or a family loved the full kitchen and the mini kitchen in the master

446, i was very surprised when i arrived at la residence at the location  immediately adjacent to very busy and noisy highway  not being from the area i relied on the photos and reviews of others and there is no mention of the proximity to the highway there were many nice seating areas around the hotel but you could not escape 
447, we enjoyed staying at la residence bed and bathroom were very comfortable surprised how nice the grounds were friendly staff for evening happy hours location is convenient if planned stops in napa and yountville

450, we had an unexpected stay in la residence courtesy of another hotel in napa that left us high and dry more on that in another review la residence came to the rescue we were very lucky to find this place literally at the last minute beautiful property quiet and romantic nicely appointed room comfortable bed great wine and cheese in 
451, after searching around for a nice quaint place my boyfriend and i decided to pick la residence and we were very happy with our choice we drove from san francisco airport to the hotel and missed our the hotel entrance it was not marked very well but once we found our way onto the street the entrance was beautiful it 
452, everything about our stay at la residence was terrific the room was beautiful the bed was super comfy it was very quiet a huge plus in my book breakfast was great the same everyday but with enough of a spread to not get boring winecheese tasting every night was excellent and helped give us some ideas of where to go 
453, stayed here for one night while touring napa very clean quiet and relaxing pool and hot tub are great and not crowded breakfast in the morning was delicious they also have a wine tasting everyday from     pm that is fun and a great way to meet other people touring napa and sharing stories about wineries to visit 
454, a group of us stayed at this hotel for a wine party in december the hotel is actually owned by the halls who also own hall wines the place is quaint and quiet our rooms were wonderful bed were comfortable and the fireplaces in each room added to the elegance our room also had a balcony which was very nice

470, came here on a random thursday and was very pleased with our stay la residence is a perfect place to stay for a casual but romantic getaway the staff was helpful and friendly but also left us and created a comfortable environment the room was clean and spacious we took advantage of the outdoor seating areas and had a great 
471, a beautiful setting with lovely grounds the rooms were clean and spacious and the bed was amazing we went down to the evening wine and cheese reception and the only turn off was it felt like another tasting versus a nice unwind from the day the breakfast was wonderful we were sad we were only able to stay one nightat 
472, i would like to especially thank candy rodriguez for going extra miles to book a great room  for us as we were on the honeymoon and booked our stay here for a last minute vacation overall service was very good and sufficient quite location and easy access to a major road we utilized in room spa services my wife and i

474, this is egret place to stay in napa it is very quaint and the service is fantastic i is small place so make reservations early and make sure to ask for one of the places the outside seating area the breakfast is included and is wonderful 
475, we chose this hotel because we wanted a non chain romantic hotel with an outdoor pool although the pool was small it was well appointed  the hotel overall was lovely there are plenty of small outdoor gathering places with a larger space outside the breakfastwine tasting area my only complaint is that there were several cobwebs on our bathroom light 
476, my husband and i spent the first  nights of our honeymoon at la residence and couldnt be happier about our choice from the bottle of chilled wine in our room upon arrival to the delicious breakfasts with relaxing views every morning this was a perfect honeymoon retreat we stayed in room  which was attached to the mansion but 
477, we arrived at la residence as the final stop on our honeymoon tour of california on and pre arrival the service was very helpful with lots of information about the local area and available tours our room was lovely styled in a colonial fashion although the staircase and hallways felt a little dated though the pool area is fantastic and 
478, spent two nights at this gorgeous bb they couldnt have been more helpful and i completely concur with other reviews great attention to detail super breakfast and afternoon treat of wine and cheese simply lovely 
479, my husband and i stayed at la residence for two days during our stay in napa the staff was so hospitable and our room was lovely the bathroom had a lot of counter space which is something most places lack the property is very pretty and we had the opportunity to just relax outside of our room on the deck

494, my girlfriend and i just spent the last  days at la residence and we enjoyed our stay immensely the level of detail through out the complex was top notch from the breakfast in the morning to the wine tasting in the evening our room was in the main building and our accommodations were wonderful and the room was immaculate 
495, my wife and i stayed at this inn during our trip to napa everything was wonderful our room had a wonderful balcony overlooking vineyards the bed was very confortable and the room was absolutely charming the breakfast was a basic continental style with hard boiled eggs free wifi and an open computer station with printer allowed us to easily print 
496, after spending many days on a road trip we were thrilled to have a two night stay at this wonderful napa valley oasis la residence did not disappoint in any area of hospitality the staff were extremely accommodating attending to our every need we stayed in the house just outside of the main building but it was steps from the main 
497, very nice clean and cozy small hotel the location is excellent within close proximity to wineries restaurants and napa city the complimentary breakfast and daily wine tasting was a nice addition to the hotel amenities the small pool and outdoor jacuzzi were great way to relax after the hot day in the valley we would love to stay here again 
498, my husband and i took our first trip to napa last week la residence was our hotel of choice its perfectly positioned along hwy  and the grounds are beautiful we had a room on the rd floor of the mansion and it was great unfortunately we arrived in the middle of a heat wave and because of that the 
499, they do not consider themselves a bb the bed and pillows were very comfortable we had a newly refurbished room which was very pleasant quiet and comfortable the bathroom had a combination shower and bathtub which is not my favorite this is a simple place to stay not a  star resort it is located right off the highway but 
500, the bb we were booked in for the weekend double booked by mistake so they made a reservation for us at la residence it was way better than expected the grounds were beautiful the front desk and service people were friendly and very helpful our room was spacious with a king size bed fireplace and a little table and chairs 
501, only stayed one night as i traveled the northern california area i really enjoyed my stay at la residence my room was very clean and the king size bed was very comfortable the cool air coming into the room during the morning made for a great sleep there is a swimming pool and warm water jaccuzi on the groundsthe place 
502, my husband and i stayed here the last two nights of our four night trip to napa while the property is located near a busy road we did not notice it in our room we were spoiled at our first location bed and breakfast so we were a little disappointed with the continental breakfast however it was still nice the 
503, the property was everything we thought it would be the location is great   just outside of napa so it is quiet and easier to access all the wineries than places in napa the rooms are fantastic all updated and have the amenities you are looking for the complimentary breakfast is what surprised us the most a very nice and

521, while planning a weekend trip to san francisco we discovered that we had a few extra days available and decided to spend them in napa although not a last minute decision we began looking for lodging a little later than we normally would we soon discovered that most of our favorite options were either booked required three night minimum stays 
522, once you arrive at the property la residence is in a very nice setting  an oasis off the highway our room was in the mansion building and was nicely appointed and spacious there was a separate sitting area when you entered as we were celebrating our anniversary there was a nice note in our room and a plate with

544, the hotel is absolutely fantastic set in beautiful and well kept grounds it really is a tranquil and serene place to stay would fully recommend staying here if you are in napa if only for a few nights graham and his staff were more than helpful and really made the stay great for us both nothing was too much trouble 
545, what a wonderful place nestled among the grapevines it is like a story book i was traveling by myself and felt comfortable welcome and safe the staff was very helpful with directions and recommendations thank you graham for your support and friendship you made things warm and so comfortable in a hard situation for me 
546, we chose this for the second leg of our th anniversary celebration the property is charmimg and well maintained there was a distinctly southern plantation feel to the property   at least to us we were thrilled with the old fashioned functioning fireplace the nice gentleman who showed us to our cottage king suite im so sorry i cannot recall his name 
547, this is a lovely place with a lovely atmosphere the staff was excellent and went out of their way to accommodate any request they made restaurant recommendations provided menus and made winery recommendations the breakfast was very good and the wine and cheese in the afternoon was perfect the room was spotless we had an upstairs room with balcony we 
548, we booked this getaway based on the overall rating we saw on this website and we should have looked at some of the individual ratings instead on booking things too quickly as we did this time the property backs up to a busy and loud highway the room we were given was in the main building and contained shabby furniture 
549, we celebrated our th wedding anniversary at la residence based on trip advisor reviews our own personal experience differed slightly from all i read prior the grounds are indeed charming location was as expected wine and cheese tasting was excellent breakfast excellent beds comfy room clean where we differ is the service i was disappointed in the lack thereof upon 
550, that was a great experience the place is a dream nice breakfast in the morning and happy hour with cheese and wine i like so much the rooms and beds its a little noise members of the staff were kind and friendly

567, as part of our week long celebration of our th anniversary we spent  nights at la residence in napa it was easy to find and provided easy access to the main freeway between the napa valley cities upon check in we asked for a recommendation for dinner and was happy to try the wonderful italian restaurant at the end 
568, we stayed three nights while we toured the napa valley the inn was very quiet and relaxing the grounds are lovely great continental breakfast each day   basically a cold buffet   cereals pastries juices yogurt cheese and meat platter quiches toast and bagels the daily wine and cheese is a nice touch our room was lovely only comment was 
569, my husband surprised me with a few days in the napa valley to celebrate our  year anniversary we had driven by la residence many times on our way to clear lake but never needed a room i had no idea it was so lovely the grounds are beautiful vineyards flowers redwoods all very lush the staff greeted us warmly 
570, we stayed here as our first stop on our honeymoon and it was so relaxing it was like a nice little personal apartment room they have wine tasting every night and they also know where to direct you to get the best food and wine in nearby citiesareas we wanted a fire that night and called down to ask for 
571, this is such a nice little place clean friendly tucked away from so much of the commercial parts of napa that are popping up and unlike nearly every other place in the valley they offer  night stays when they can the wine hour and the breakfast also add value and while they have downgraded the gourmet quality of their food 
572, we booked  cottage kings in early march the cottage kings were spacious and quiet the breakfast compared nicely to our other favorite napa retreat the harvest inn as breakfast consisted of a choice of meets cheeses fruits pastries and cereal however what made our stay truly wonderful were the exceptional staff they even served one of ourfavorite hallwines the 
573, a friend and i traveled to napa for a spring break sojourn and were absolutely delighted with la residence she was lucky to find a groupon deal which lured us to the property in the first place but marketing is only the first step when one feels cared for as we were one returns our room in the mansion was

591, we had an amazing stay at this resort we were there for a birthday the only downfall was the employee they had pouring during their happy hour she was horrid we had met some other guests staying at the resort so all  of us went over for happy hour wine pouring in the lobby after pouring us one pour 
592, we stayed here for just one night in napa but were so thrilled with our choice of la residence the hotel was so adorable and cozy our room was homey but romantic and the bathroom was really clean and well maintained we felt like we were staying in the guest room of a wealthy friends wine country estate wine and 
593, we were here for our honeymoon stayed in room  and enjoyed every minute check in was a breeze we were led to the mansion we had nd floor front room fireplace king bed chairs outside on the balcony to soak in the afternoon sun the grounds are fantastic with a nice pool great hot tub two fountains and fire 
594, this is a perfect get away inn for the personcouple wanting to get away from the hustle and bustle of the big hotel chains this is located within walking distance to don giovannis the rooms are cozy and there is a continental breakfast each morning with an evening wine tasting hour 
595, we stayed two nights here in early february for our honeymoon in one of the cottage rooms the hotel had placed a bottle of champagne and a hand written congratulations card in our room   so personal we had lovely sunny weather while we were there so we had the doors open to the patio   it was so pleasant 
596, ive visted napa many times but didnt even know this was here its like a little wine country estate of a few buildings and grounds hidden just off the highway next to bistro don giovanni this is not a bustling resort hotel but sort of like someones well appointed vacation home with twenty something rooms our room was in a side house 
597, charming rooms  setting very nice people nestled along the highway but youll never know its there eclectic collection of original house and new quarters walk a very short way to a nice bistrot and la res itself had a pleasant wine tasting cocktail hour pool not heated when we were there    degrees outside 
598, the pool was not heated and very disconcerting from the on line photos the hot tub is a hike from the main house mattress not comfortable and the shower difficult to adjust the hot and cold called the mainline several times to request wake up calls and no one picks up the line 
599, i purchased a groupon deal and was not expecting too much but knew i was in for a real treat when i pulled up on saturday the property was well manicured the staff was ever so friendly and the room was ready at am check in time was at pm the complimentary happy hour from  pm was fabulous and the complimentary breakfast

614, it was unfortunate that we could not spend more than one night at la residence it was an intermittent stop over for us and everything about the place is charming we were unable to exsperience all the amenities such as the evening wine tasting but the total ambiance of the place was really special what made it even more special 
615, we visited la residence right after christmas  i loved the serenity and old charm of the property the room was very spacious clean and comfortable i typically am extremely picky about accomodations to the point where i lysol everything and wrap the remote in a ziploc bag there was no need for that here the staff was very friendly 
616, im an avid trip taker and in fact am an editor at a national magazine where i oversee the travel section so i did my due diligence in research before happening upon this property my fiance and i were looking forward to staying there after i purchased a weekend visit for him as a birthday present unfortunately i came down with 
617, this secluded property just off the highway has every thing you need for a nice trip to wine country complementary breakfast and wine happy hour are icing on the cake rooms are nicely appointed with big windows a fireplacesmall fridge robes and an ironing board you can pay a lot more for the same things at other places 
618, we recently stayed at la residence the week between christmas and new year what a great find the inn is located along hwy  on the west side of napa access to and from the inn is easy walking distance to bistro don giovannis when you enter the drive to the inn you find yourself secluded from the hwy behind 
619, my husband and i just returned from a short napa getaway we stayed at la residence on a friends recommendation and they were absolutely right on the entire staff were extremely friendly and helpful we enjoyed the wine reception continental breakfast and just spending time in our beautifully appointed room the fireplace bags were a nice touch and having a 
620, bought a deal for two nights here at  a night here is what happened  arrived on time for the wine and cheese reception which consisted of a handful of cheese one meat and some crackers that were put out in small quantities the wine pouring were mostly tasting pours and so one had to ask for four tastings 
621, we stayed here for  nights last august as the last leg of our trip from portland or to san francisco the hotel is lovely set in a vineyard close to a main road but thanks to clever landscaping there was very little if any road noise elegant with beautiful grounds and fountain our room was on the ground floor 
622, we had a great time in napa valley la residence felt like home and was a great central location to see all of the surrounding wine country the service was excellent the people were friendly and eager to help the fireplace in our room had a cozy fire every night just a wonderful place to relax and escape

639, the staff was very friendly and helpful even before we arrived for our stay the room was very nice although i wouldnt have expected less for the price the disappointment came in having to call the front desk every night to request items that should have been replaced by the maid there was also a problem with the toilet and 
640, i booked a large group at la residence for my wifes birthday party the staff was extremely helpful they suggested places to visit arranged bike rentals and arranged taxis and a contact at a limo rental service there are several types of rooms some located in the original bb house and others in newer buildings spread around the property the

645, we stayed here for  nights in october and paid  per night the property is attractive with well kept grounds however for the price we paid i have to say we were slightly disappointed the check in area is something that you would expect in a bbhostel and our room in the main house although very large clean and 
646, we booked a two night non refundable stay a few months ago and the rate was not cheap for booking in advance at night we were expecting a room on a grander scale and were fairly disappointed we were taken to a corner room on the third floor not much of a view the room is just ok the shutters did 
647, what a great place to stay so i went out to napa with the intent to propose to my then girlfriend now fiancee i was torn between doing it at one of the winerys we were to visit and the hotel but when we got to la residence i knew i could pull it off in fine style there i

662, we stayed at la residence over a three night period sunday wednesday recently at the tail end of our vacation out west we struggled to find the ideal location in napa and chose la residence based on reviews on various sites the other reviewers who mention the wonderful hospitality are correct david went above and beyond to make our stay at la 
663, a very average quality country inn which seems to have a hype of a boutique hotel  except the outdoor patio outside the breakfast room there is really nothing boutique style about this place standard rooms are a complete rip off since they dont offer anything more than a normal average size room with old furniture and draperies as for 
664, we stayed in the la residence for  nights as part of an amazing road trip around california of all the places we stayed we found napa the hardest location from which to initially pick accommodation we finally settled on la residence as its location just on the edge of napa town meant we could escape quickly into the heart 
665, my wife and i stayed a couple of nights and the hospitality was amazing one night we grabbed a bottle of champagne and were going to head out to the hot tub the nice lady behind the desk stopped us to make sure that we had proper glasses and a tub of ice to keep our champagne cold it was 
666, very nice experience continental breakfast was very good with fresh fruit baked goods and other tasty items wine tasting in the evening was even better with good wines and very good hors doeuvres only drawbacks would be mattress needs replacing and location is very close to route  still a very good choice 
667, we stayed in october for my husbands birthday trip to napa the location is perfect to go visit wineries the setting very nicely done among trees fountain vineyards on our arrival there were yummy cheesecakes in the fridge the big king bed was wonderful get in and you immediately fall asleep little sitting area outside on the deck breakfast was 
668, my family booked several rooms for a group birthday in october positives extremely helpful staff always willing to accommodate guests and special requests very much appreciated also although the location is next to the highway the inn has managed to hide that roads noise level and make it go away visually the rooms are charming although some have very small 
669, staff was incredibly attentive and helpfulwe had let them know we were on our honeymoon when we reserved and we had a bottle of champagne awaiting us when we arrived location was great to visit the wineries and there was a wonderful pool and hot tub to relax in the afternoonsroom and bathroom were huge and we greatly enjoyed the 
670, this is a nice hotel but a bit pricey for the product we were there during a high season weekend the room was nice even though the tv seemed a bit under sized the breakfast was not as good as i think it might have been   the pastries seemed tired even slightly stale and i know there are good 
671, room was very clean and had a working fireplace you had to just ask the front desk for a duraflame log grounds were really maintained and the staff was very helpful and nice breakfast was very ordinary basically its toast and cereal mainly but the wine they give you when you get there and also in the evenings more than

736, the accommodations were excellent we had a king cottage room   it was very large had a nice view of the vineyard though it is a very small vineyard   about  feet x  feet or something the service was excellent though the location is perfect quiet but right off the highway 
737, the grounds and the whole concept behind this location is great beautiful peaceful and serene externally it all works however they are either resting on that or they never really achieved it as it is not there our first room  had an overwhelming moldmildew smell unbearable prompting us to request a room change yes they were very nice about 
738, warm and friendly staff in beautiful surroundings the convenient location cannot be beat we will return and will also highly recommend la residence to friends and family all day fruits coffee and tea afternoon coookies and evening wine and cheese were nice touches

763, if your idea of a great getaway is a peaceful fully appointed resort where staff are eager to attend to your every need i recommend la residence the grounds were so beautiful and quiet the room was excellent and all the little extras made it truly enjoyable be it the wine and cheese on the back deck at  pm

809, my wife and i had avery nice  night stay here we got the larger king room which i recommend as it has a table and chairs out on a porch overlooking a little on property vineyard like  rows of vines it is well located at the northern most tip or napa town which feels more secluded even though right on

811, we stayed at la residence saturday night for our weekend in napa we stayed in room  upstairs in the main house which was very large and had a great bathroom the price was about average for the area i mainly chose it because they have a  night minimum which is kind of rare in napa here are some 
812, we stayed at la residence for  night and had a really great stay they rooms are comfortable and cosy the bed was amazing the grounds are very well kept my only very slight issue was that it is next to a busy road but its not a great problem it is in a great location within easy reach of

832, my husband and i stayed here a few weeks ago and were pleasantly surprised id like to take credit for finding this place but a friend of ours actually suggested it he recommends it to all of his visitors  first off thank you for being so clean i am a germaphobe and usually find myself tip toeing around everything 
833, my significant other and i stayed at this hotel a few weeks ago and i must say it was one of the most serene get a ways weve had in quite sometime our room was cozy and full of antiques and the bed was amazing best night of sleep ive had in a longtime i loved that the hot tub is open 
834, my wife and i decided to spend the weekend in napa and wanted a quiet and peaceful bb for some rr tis was the first time we stayed at the la residence and will not be the last we booked the cottage suite which had a separate living room where we could relax after a day of wine tasting the 
835, this is a wonderful place to stay great rooms location breakfast and afternoon wine and cheese 
836, overall we had a pleasant experience but there were a lot of missed details that could have given them a five star rating when we first arrived the room smelled of creosol from the fireplace we were told that this is normal with fireplaces it is not normal but come to find out the damper was left open the smell 
837, we booked la residence last minute online although we were a bit surprise at the location out of napa town and close to the highway it was a great place to stay our room although a bit old fashioned was large clean and comfortable the staff were friendly and very helpful helping us to organise a tour of the wine 
838, this is my first time in and i was disappointed to be away from a walk able area location is right off the main road and area is a little shabby if this hotel was in a better location i would come again also the photos on tripadvisor make the grounds look a lot more elegant than reality it is 
839, this was the perfect place to stay it was our first trip staying in napa and we came across la residence via travelzoo we hoped for the best and we were not disappointed the location s great very close to most of the wineries we did have a driver but we didnt spend too much time traveling from the hotel

854, la residence was large enough to take care of our needs and small enough that you built a relationship with the staff while you were there the room was great the location was wonderful for running through the vineyards in the morning to try and burn off the calories you accumulate while touring the wineries and the  happy hour 
855, the service of the staff and friendliness is way ahead of most other hotels i have visited nation wide it is a quaint inn with beautiful surroundings agreat place to launch your wine tour from and a very relaxing environment to return to in the evening it is quiet and has all the amenities you would need for your napa 
856, i booked my trip to la residence based on reviews from friends of mine who had stayed there they ranted and raved about the property and the chef i searched and searched for a bb in napa and i finally came down to  choices and the breakfast was going to be the deciding factor because of the things i 
857, spent one night here while in the san francisco area wish we had stayed longer great location for the wine country excellent rooms and great service 
858, la residence is located in the middle of wine country and in very close distance to numerous excellent wineries and restaurants the room is large ad cozy with a romantic fireplace always ready to be fired up wine tastings at  pm are a perfect touch that well complement the nice breakfasts in the morning staff is kind and helpful 
859, we spent a few days here recently and were impressed overall this place is truly unique with its older buildings and beautiful landscaping and sits among some grape fields certainly not one of your cookie cutter chain hotels which is exactly why we chose it the leaves were just beginning to change and the place was very pretty overall while 
860, sunshine and first class service in napa and only an hour and a bit north of san francisco this quaint little gem lies just off ca   a boutique guest house of the finest kind all the properties are timber built with one particularly fine statehouse and balcony theyre all beautifully restored and represent a bit of old america trees 
861, i was expecting a much more upscale room the bed and pillows were comfortable but the room was a little dowdy and the bathroom was in need of help the shower was so small you couldnt turn around and it wouldnt drain i definely would choose another location next time 
862, despite the reviews we were frankly disappointed by la residence and would not stay here again we stayed in room  which is a very private room with its own entrance nearby the hot tub the room showed fairly well but here are the key problems  the bed was a small queen and extremely uncomfortable soft and unsupportive and 
863, this is the first review we have ever written for a hotel or innor even a travel website of any kind but we could not resist telling everyone about the terrific long weekend we had last weekend at the la residence country inn in the wine country firstwe noticed the grounds were absolutely beautifulthe check in was simply deligthful and

902, stunning grounds with small vineyards planted for a feeling of being surrounded by the vine breakfasts were really nice in a quaint dining room or out on the patio as was afternoon wine tasting the room was nice small bb style but very clean didnt love being on the first floor as other residents could walk past the many windows 
903, the service was attentive very warm and friendly we were in contact with the staff before we arrived and they were so helpful with reservations for restaurants and winery tours we are two close girlfriends that havent seen each other in a long time so we wanted to stay somewhere that would allow us to spend time together at the

910, traveling through napa valley and was suggested to try this place in all my trips to the area for wine tasting i had never stayed here what a gem great location a little oasis on two acres with the mountains and vineyards and the gardens made for a relaxing peaceful stay we stayed in the main building on the second

928, we have stayed at la residence several times by ourselves and with a group of friends and we just had to comment on our new favorite napa retreat what a wonderful hidden gem right on the main drag at the gateway to the valley just minutes from all that the valley has to offer from arrival to checkout everything was 
929, for the most part we enjoyed our stay at la residence but it lacked the wow factor i was hoping for and the luxury that their website describes at the price i was paying i expected more likes   grounds the best part of the inn lots of little gardens and sitting places to read a book or sip a

952, i wish i couls say i like it here the property is beautiful semi well located and the staff was great morning breakfasts and evening wine tasting were great butits all about the room the main problem is that the front door to your room is also the window and it is on a corridor whch serves other rooms so when 
953, at la residence they make the extra effort to make your stay in the valley an experience to remember as an experienced traveler la residence has hit the mark with comfortable beds and fireplaces in the room to make for a rejuvanating stay however it is the extras that put la residence into the repeat stay category and recommend to

975, we had a great time in la residence they had excellent service over there we stayed upstairs in the main building the room was pretty decent size but the queen bed was a bit small the bathroom was very spacious with a modern touch the property itself was not too big we went in low season so its pretty quite 
976, this is our second time at la residence for thanksgiving we continue to love this bb hotel but we cannot give them  stars  here are some of our observations  the rooms are too small for   night before tax a price of  would be already plenty  the beds are designated as queen size but to

978, la residence is a charming property from the exterior with a fabulous staff but the rooms are severely lacking the luxury qualties advertised we stayed for three nights in a junior suite in the old mansion the room was extremely stuffy during the night making it impossible to sleep the bathroom drawer fell out onto the floor when opened the

980, we just stayed at la residence and it couldnt have been more perfect we rented the cottage suites and they were large and very private i had read reviews of noise but the highway noise seemed to be very light if any at all the only noise we encountered was the huge warming fans from the middle of the vineyard 
981, we booked this inn based on the review and photos we spent two nights in just a king room for our honeymoon spending about  per night on a weekday which were beyond our expectations the bed was very comfortable with many pillows and a down comforter their continental breakfast is wonderful and yummie with a choice of  items 
982, following a rather hectic vacation having spent time in las vegas and san francisco we finished off with two nights at la residence following an easy min drive from san francisco we found the hotel easily on the north side of napa on driving in to the property we were immediately impressed with the attention to detail given to the

997, this inn is fantastic this was our rd trip to napa  the inn was the best place we stayed so far the grounds are beautiful and the rooms are very nice comfy beds but the best part about this inn is that the staff makes you feel very welcome breakfast is very nice but the wine hour is great 
998, we booked this stay through expedia and found the reviews here to be a bit alarming either they loved it or hated it after experiencing our stay we are baffled why anyone could have anyhing negative to say about this fabulous place the grounds are meticulously manicured the rooms are far superior to the stays weve had at more upper
