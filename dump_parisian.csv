16, stayed here during spring break almost every hotel and motel in miami beach was full the room was not very clean or nice the shower could only produce very warm or very cold water the window faced a wall the worst part about this hotel was that you could hear everything that was going on in the room next door 
17, my family stayed here last summer in the penthousenot a penthouse just a top floor facing colllins we were traveling on a budget so we thought it wouldnt be that bad it is absolutely the worst hotel i have ever stayed at just a step above a dirty hostel really the floors were dirty and disgusting towels were a joke

38, the rooms were more or less acceptable but the worst thing was breakfast its hilarious that they even call it so no bread no milk no egg no fruit only a horrible cafe and a couple of cheap uneatable muffins last but not least when i tried to pay with my credit card they told me that it wasnt working

91, i got there scarred because of the reviews i read after doing my bookingmy bas in fact when we first arrived there a couple of customers were complying because of some problem with their bathroom and the worker told them to leave the place if they didnt like it it tooke long time to check in about  min but 
92, i stayed in this hotel for just one night with my brother mom and son originally we all had rooms in the parisian but my room door didnt close so they gave me a room next door in the geneva and that only after i made a fuss because i had been waiting for hour for the handyman george to 
93, we found ourselves having to take a one night stay here last month we couldnt wait to leave whilst the lobby entire is inviting enough the hotel room was thoroughly depressing it reminded me of something out of a cheap horror movie the air con blew freezing cold air continuously into our room yes   we were shivering in miami 
94, we spent only olny one night at the parisian but that was enough the beds are from the early s and so they feel like the bed lines are partially dirty also the rest of the room the rooms were not updated since a long time they said breakfast is included breakfast was only a cup of coffe with whitener 
95, we stayed at the parisian during wmc week because we booked the trip last minute and there werent many options without paying an arm and a leg we had very low expectations going in to it but could not imagine just how bad it would be we took a red eye from california so we arrived very early in the 
96, went there in january after booking with expedia we were surprised by the  dollar cash deposit most hotels just take your credit card only two people at a time can ride the elevator wanted to take a late night bath but all the hot water was used breakfast was a bunch of pastries and no coffee was even made 
97, this hotel is in a great location if you want to stay in south beach for cheap the hotel is very old and run down the rooms havent been updated since the early s the beds were so old and the sheets were thin and disgusting tv was an old tube tv and there is nothing good to say about 
98, this place epitomizes horrendousfrom the rooms to the staff id have a hard time justifying this hotel for night in tijuanaseriously its a cesspool of a hotel smoking rooms beds with coils sticking out no ac control on max with no onoff or temp control not trash can no shower head badly stained carpets broken blinds and a staff that

108,horrible rudeugly and nasty employee
109,the worst
110, when ape like creatures gathered themselves together invented fire realised the absence of humour in adam sandler films and finally moved out of feces lined caves i think they imagined they would never return to that place sadly some modern day hominids had the misfortune of unearthing the cave or parisian hotel  suites as they call it now the 
111, horrible customer service both when i tried contacting them via phone to ask some questions about check in and luggagei asked when check in was they told me and then promptly hung up without letting me ask any other questions i might have had or informing me about an early check in option they had they had a complimentary breakfast but it was pastries 
112, worst stay ever at a hotel wasnt expecting a  star resort at all but definately wasnt expecting a   resort rude spaced out front desk worker who often would fall asleep with head on counter rooms dirty darkmusty old halfway house furniture appeal sheets stained bed old and uncomfortable pillows old and flat small old tv with few channels 
113, the rooms are filthy the carpet was stained from last nights party the stairwells are littered with old mattresses the night crew was was very pleasant but the woman in the morning was a miserable witch please dont stay here unless you like hip hop at  am and bed bugs when the lights go out ps the free breakfast 
114, now this isnt a  star place but it is clean the staff is awesome norma monica and yolanda are so helpful and sweet older hotel but room was comfy and very clean they use actual cleaning supplies not just water like some of the bigger hotels and the pastries for breakfast are amazing great location we would definitely go 
115, i went for a pleasant leisure trip in march just because i wanted a pleasant holiday in florida and we needed the cheapest hotel we could find we failed to read the reviews before  read them now some were pleasant all n all i would stay again pleasant enough 
116, we had arranged the reservation through expedia same day as the stay but upon review of the room at pm which was still being cleaned since we first got to the hotel at pm found no toilet paper multiple fluid stains all over the carpet empty pill casings under the bed no toiletries shampoo etc and a funky odor upon 
117, this is the most disgusting place ive ever stayed me and my mom traveled  hours to get here when we tried to check in they told us to wait cause they were doing a shift change and couldnt help us we waited  minutes when me and my mom got to the room we both cried there was a 
118, this was the most horrible experience ive had in a hotel staff is extremely nasty and rude the rooms lobby elevator all dirty smelly no air conditioning do not stay in this hotel or you will end up getting sick from poor hygiene of those pigs who work there 
119, this is the worst hotel i have ever stayed at the room was dirty and the staff didnt care to do anything about it after we asked for a clean room the staffs attitude was rude i was told the coffee was the problem of the morning maids and would have to wait till  for the coffee and continental

129,worst hotel in miami
130, my sister and i stayed here on our last night in south beach and the room was terrible it was dirty and old cracks on the walls and no hot water my entire room smelled like weed from the other patrons smoking and i dont even want to start on the uncomfortableness of the bed pillows were flat as pancakes 
131, i would highly recommend this hotel for people who are over  yrs old but not yet  dont be fooled by other peoples reviews ive stayed here  times and have yet to have a problem involving health or safety issues you get what you pay for location 
132, we stayed here for  nights and the location is great you can walk down to south beach in  minutes walk to ocean drive restaurants and nightlife and lincoln road shopping the hotel is not of the highest standard and the staff is not very nice but the location is worth it almost no breakfast only coffe juice and 
133, room sucked old shower didnt work right dirty bed was old and dippy sink  inches into the mattress only five channels on the tv one sports one spanish not enough lighting even bugs would not stay here poor wash cloths for towels its no wonder we were one of two quests registered here good points ummmm the coffee was 
134, a friend and i stayed here from march th th although our reservations were from march th th let me explain we choose the wrong week to go down to miami because the wmc was going on at the time and it was almost impossible to find a hotel so we walked up to the doorsteps of the parisian hotel and suites 
135, why on earth this facility is allowed to operate as a hotel motel or a holiday inn is beyond me the nightmare began when we arrived at this dump in the atrium as we were told that a  security deposit would need to be collected before check in as in the event there is damagewtf    they shouldve paid us 
136, ive stayed in crappy hotels before but those were when i was younger  looking for a place to get my groove on for an hour and for  the floors under the carpet were warped  made noises every time you walked the carpet made my feet black the rooms set up looked worse than a poor single college 
137, i stayed in this hotel during the wmc perfect location for this evet 
138, first off i would like to say that if you are going to schedule touring trips down in the front do not deal with raul this guy is a joke we schedule deep sea fishing with him for three people which was a  dollar deposit for each person we told him that we were not sure if the third 
139, some friends and i stayed here during wmc  because of the price and location the location is great and thats about where any good stuff ends the rooms in this hotel are atrocious dirty with rust stains bugs missing shower curtains mold the list goes on we honestly felt like we were living in some sort of crack house 
140,they are big thieves sleep on the street you will be comfortable
141,they have miceroaches and nasty staff
142,mice
143,do not stay at this hotel
144,dont do it unless your desperate
145,they stole my money
146,no
147,parisian cells
148,satans home sweet home
149,short stay at the parisian
150, worst hotel i have seen in my  years of travel and do not stay here even if the only alternative is the streets they charged us for  nights in advance and we were forced to check out next and there they said they have a no return policy 
151, stay far far awaymy friend and i arrived to the hotel on may   at pmwe walked up to the front desk and both of the receptionists my informationhe then very rudely told me to its not even pm yet so i shouldnt be rushing him to check us in and he still hadnt received my info from hotelscom 
152, all i can say is do not stay in this hotel we went to bed early with the intention of resting for our flight back home the next day but we were woken at one in the morning by the sound of something going through our suitcasewe turned the lights on to find nobodywell almost nobody there was a mouse 
153, this place was very depressing and not very clean front desk could not locate the manager who would reimburse me so i called my credit card to handle the dispute only stay at this hotel if you are desperate hotelscom should be ashamed to even advertise this hotel spend the money for a better nights stay 
154, so i decided to book last minute and ended up at the parisian we ended up paying a fortune for this dump i felt very unsafe and the room was depressing and veryyyyy small the tv had maybe  channels and the you could hear everything thru the walls dont do it unless you are desperate 
155, dont come here the guy at the front desk gave away my  dollar deposit to someone else and left for the day the manager wouldnt give me my rightful money even though it was her employees mistake this hotel pretty much stole money from methe manager said they would mail it to me when they figured stuff out yeah 
156, my sister and i had a really rough night at this hotel we woke up at  am sweating hot no ac my sister went to the front desk and asked what was going on and he said yeah im really hot too i think the air cond is broke or something he told her that there is a nob 
157, i had the misfortune to stray into this hovel the people who where staying in this place looked like they had just been released from jail the room was terrible and the bathroom was worse in addition to this there was a full scale riot outside our room and the whole time i was praying that the choas wouldnt spill 
158, this is not a hotel i would feel more safe in jail then in this poor excuse for  walls a ceiling and a toilet with no back cover this hotel is most absolutely disgusting im getting std tested tomorrow thanks ps   hotelscom is retarded 
159, while the hotel is not a five star establishment it is clean and convenient to the beach and all miami beach attractions two min to the beach five min to lincoln road and all the restaurants the airconditioning worked well and the rooms were modest beds dresser nightstand and tv if you are looking to take a break in south 
160,believe me u dont want to stay at this hotel
161,avoid hotelscom   misrepresentation and charged me twice the amount
162,do not stay here

166,nasty rat trap
167,pleasantly surprised
168,terrible dangerous and awful do not stay there
169,dont go there
170, i dont recommend this hotel to anybody i had a horrible experience i reserved a room at the parisian once i checked in i found out that i was goin to stay at geneve the building next door sister it didnt take long for me to realized how bad my room it was goin to be as i was walking 
171, hotelscom has many other websites that they run to confuse the customer cheaphotelscom is another one of theirs made a reservation for this nasty rat hole parisian hotel cheaphotelscom charged me  night where as the regular hotel price is about the half of this they totally mistrepresented the facts on their website about the hotel i would say avoid 
172, simply read all of the reviews they have said it all on top of it the staff is rude non resposive and apear to care less about your concerns felt total unsafe and exposed health wise the city of miami beach shound condem the place or at least see that they get rid of the bed bugs 
173, where do i begin on what a horrible hotel this was the lobby was not even air conditioned in fact we didnt even spend the night the staff was horrible harrassing us and actually insulting some of us because of our orientation just a horrible horrible experience the room was also disgusting no ac 
174, i hated the hotel no refrigerator towels were ripped pillow cases were not changed every night looks like an apartment building dont get up early for complimentary breakfast  waste of timehorrible breakfast 
175, where do i begin we got there and they said they were overbooked so they said that wed have to stick around in the afternoon all day the next day so that we could switch rooms the next day not only were they inconveniencing us but all the staff were extremely rude they told us that planes get overbooked so 
176, this place was so terrible i dont know where to begin the front desk lady was rude the hallway was dark and nasty and the climb up the stairs to our suite was less than inviting then when we open the door to our suite the tears started to roll our little vacation had turned into a nightmare in just 
177, based on the past reviews i did not expect much but since i was on a budget i took a chance to my surprise the rooms were spacious and clean the furniture was basic but looked fairly new and the bed comfortablethe location was great i walked to everything the only improvement would be there so called free continental breakfast 
178, this was my worst experience ever with hotels it is cheaper than most of the hotels around but we paid around   per night which is not cheap in general i assume the rooms are terrible and dirty there is no design if you are shown a picture of this hotel you will never see the picture of the room 
179, my friend and i ended up booking into the parisian as a last minute thing as we had decided to move out of the hotel we were originally staying in as that was also a disaster area and hoping for something better how wrong could we have been we booked through expedia and thought we had found ourselves a great 
180,birthday bash bashed

185,horrible place
186,so so so awful
187,roach motel
188,bed bug infested hole
189,parisian  genevia not so great
190, this run down horrible place should be forced to remodel we paid  for a weekend suite and got a disgusting surprise we had to do some remodeling of our own just to take a shower the kitchenette had a stove with some unexplainable hairs on it this place was undiscribable in filth it was my best friends birthday and 
191, my two girlfriends and i booked this so called  star hotel called the parisian on hotels when we arrived we were told the parisian was booked and we were staying in the hotels affiliate hotel next door called the geneva we went next door and it was a lobby for thrify rent a car however there was an   x  sheet 
192, ive been to south beach   times over the past   years and stayed at different hotels everytime i book packages from travelocity or expedia and relied on their rating system it has never been so wrong i thought the traymore was bad but the parisian was even worse we needed a room for  people since our friend decided 
193, won a bid off of priceline for  on miami beach come on people what are you looking for in a hotel for that price and location the way i look at it is if you are bidding like a cheap person you should be expecting the results to match in this case my  was matched with an ok 
194, this is definitely the worst place i have ever stayed the limited complimentary parking is probably for employees only since we had to park  blocks from the hotel and pay day there was a hugh roach in the bathtub the bathtub window did not have a blind the water pressure was extremely weak the mini fridge was on the 
195, we booked this hotel for  nights based on the info stated on the hotel website what could be further from the truth i could only compare this place with a run down barracks in a third world country we checked out after one night the bed was stinky and broken all night there was suspicious traffic in the corridor 
196, my now finace and i stayed at the parisian for  nights our st night was new years eve we checked in and i wanted to cry it was a dungeon no carpets or rugs a hole punched in the wall no curtains no ac the windows didnt open ummm hello were in miami its hot outside the window was 
197, do not stay here the hotel conveniently lost our reservations during spring break week despite our pre paying travelocity months in advance leaving us desperate and paying holiday inn top dollar for last minute rooms plus hours of waiting on the travelocity customer service thats outsourced to somewhere in india 
198, checked into hotel and on first night discovered bed bugs really fully of blood in our bed upgraded to a suite which was okay but still getting bitten by something maybe fleas this time moved to geneva hotel next door owned by same outfit as parisian and early one morning awoken by angry drug dealers who had pursued someone to 
199, shower curtain on inside was loaded with mold carpet was b a dmore like cheap very stained outdoor carpet beds flimsy and squeeked could not control room temp could hear phone ring and people talking in room next to us hard wood floors in hall made for very loud noise when people walking the genevia hotel next door owned by same place

211, lady at the desk morning in her s blond straight hair never smiles was extremely rude and non professional   hotel  occupied  the housekeepers check list was on the reception desk in front of me but woman refused early check in  which i requested by email  hours earlier i got there at  am and waited in 
212, this hotel does not offer what it advertises sub standard is an understatement i will never go back it was so bad i checked out the next morning elevators dont work downstairs bathroom broken room grungy walls and bathroom tiles dirty sheets old they didnt smell fresh breakfast other than seeing people with coffee i saw i other breakfast items 
213, stayed from this company in a hostel i liked the room it was big comfortable and cool very cheap safe and nice local people living there breakfast is poor only drinks and some sweet pastriesbut i would stay in this hostel again its cheap good location everything is close shops party beach 
214, we had an awesome time the staff was excellent never needed for anything and everything was very clean will be back we loved it the area the hotel in is great its walking distance to everything and it was so nice to be greeted by the staff when you got back and they also work great about telling us about 
215, i stayed here with a companion during spring break for one night on a spur of the moment trip to south beach the only reason we stayed it because it was the only place available that night that wasnt nite the only positive thing about this place is its location very convenient to ocean dr and miami nightlife its a scary 
216, stayed here during spring break almost every hotel and motel in miami beach was full the room was not very clean or nice the shower could only produce very warm or very cold water the window faced a wall the worst part about this hotel was that you could hear everything that was going on in the room next door 
217, my family stayed here last summer in the penthousenot a penthouse just a top floor facing colllins we were traveling on a budget so we thought it wouldnt be that bad it is absolutely the worst hotel i have ever stayed at just a step above a dirty hostel really the floors were dirty and disgusting towels were a joke 
218, the only good thing about this place is the location the staff was not friendly the room was bad and so was the breakfast close to the beach the room was cold and we couldnt turn of the air conditioning 
219, i am not even sure where to start here see my pictures and if you still want to stay here you have problems here is my list  safe didnt work  mold all over the floors  rooms were hot as hell and smelled  no ac control in room no fans  oven didnt work fridge didnt work
